# Picnic Panic

## Background

Picnic Panic is a fun game that drops fruit from the top of your screen to the bottom of your screen. When the game starts, fruits will immediately start dropping. The basket will start at the center of the screen. You gain points by catching the fruits in your basket. A single user is able to move their basket side to side moving their mouse. 

## Functionality & MVP
With Picnic Panic, players will be able to:

- [X] Start, quit, restart the game
- [X] Catch fruits in their basket
- [X] See their current score (caught fruits/ missed) and accuracy score

This project will also include:
- [X] A How-To modal-ish screen that will describe the rules/ how to play the game
- [X] The About modal-ish screen that will include links to the creator's Github, LinkedIn, and Portfolio
- [X] A production README

## Wireframes
This app will consist of a single screen with a game board, highest score display, and an About modal.
The game board will display the start button and will tell the user to click the start button.
The About modal will include instructions for the game as well as links to the GitHub and my LinkedIn.
On the same section as the About modal will be a volume logo meant to toggle on or off the music.
