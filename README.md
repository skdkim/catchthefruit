# CatchTheFruit

## Background

Catch the Fruits is a fun game that drops fruit from the top of your screen to the bottom of your screen where you catch it in a basket. If you're the kind of person who is always missing a catch because you time it too fast or too slow, you'll love this game because it's easier than life and if you're good at catching you'll rock this game! 


## Functionality & MVP
With Catch the Fruit, players will be able to:

- [ ] Start, pause, and reset the game
- [ ] Toggle on/off the music
- [ ] Catch fruits in their basket
- [ ] See their current score vs highest score within a session

This project will also include:
- [ ] An About modal that will describe the rules/ how to play the game
- [ ] The About modal will also include links to the Github and my LinkedIn
- [ ] A production README

## Wireframes
This app will consist of a single screen with a game board, highest score display, and an About modal.
The game board will display the start button and will tell the user to click the start button.
The About modal will include instructions for the game as well as links to the GitHub and my LinkedIn.
On the same section as the About modal will be a volume logo meant to toggle on or off the music.
