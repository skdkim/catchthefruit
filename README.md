The objective of the game is catch as many falling fruits as you can into the basket. A standard game throws 25 fruits from random positions of the screen ceiling but in endless mode you can go for as long as you want.

## How to Play
You are the basket in Picnic Panic. The basket follows the mouse's movement. Catch the falling fruits with the basket.

At the top of the screen there are three scores, number of caught fruits, number of missed fruits, and an accuracy percentage.
